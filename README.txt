Billboard Hunger
=====================
Purpose:
Given 40 musical artists, what would be the quickest route to get
from one of them to another?

What's going on:
Given 40 artists, randomlly generate connections between them.
Then allow the user to pick a start and end artist.  After that,
well, we run though the algorithim and show the user the shortest
path available.

What I'm aiming for:
Pull artists from 2 locations with different sizes
Randomlly generate connections
Traverse the graph, give some indication of what the shortest path is
	and what other paths were considered.


Feeling Lucky?:
Draw using raphael.js, make it 'purdy', do a barrel roll
