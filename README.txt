Billboard Hunger
=====================
Purpose:
Given 40 musical artists, what would be the quickest route to get
from one of them to another?

What's going on:
Given 40 artists, randomlly generate connections between then.
Then allow the user to pick a start and end artist.  After that,
well, we run though the algorithim and show the user the shortest
path available.

What I'm aiming for:
Set list of artists, ability to add more.
Randomlly generate connections, edit them if needed.
Traverse the graph, give some indication of what the shortest path is
	and what other paths were considered.
